## How About You?

I'm a bit low on **Telephathy**, so I couldn't exactly Tell what _'Turns your Rocker'_?

If there are an ideas you'd like me to try out, _experiment_, _explore_ [& **create**]- any sand castels, that needs sophisticated math modelling

you _wanna_ just another **random variable** i.i.d
_levy process_?  a _Laplacian_
Is it a  _Parametric_, _non-parametric Bayesian_?

Do you _just_ Happen to be into _AI_ (it's just a Stochastic Process Optimization)
are you looking for a **Genetic algorithm** ?
(maybe a **Reinforcement model** is what you aim at), or the greatest thing you could **Dream Off**

Feel free drop me a line - who knows, maybe it will be the **next Big Thing**
