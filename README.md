# üêâ Pathei-Mathos

the __Right Mindset__, you start with: <br />
- the Golden Rule: "know that there is ~~everything~~ `something` for everyone, which stems from :<br />

*1.1. **Close*** an `open-loop`  that is nagging One loop at a time- promise? <br/>

*1.2. **Do*** a Minor good (whichever you may percieve ) <br/>

_1.3. **Rewind**_ _#1.1_ _(it gets only better, with time)_ <br/>

Feel at ease from the steepness of Failure_, as there's still time to:

_2.1. **Learn**_ something similar, easier to maintain  *( `ERROR!` sounds *familiar?*) worst thing, you'd be losing the current battle _(cut your losses short)_ <br />

_2.2. **Do**_ the work, daily , & care less about any outcomes - remember, you are living in a goal-less life <br />

2.3. **Magic**: ah, that moment, when the magic comes- invites you  enter into the `Zone` <br />
and be in the moment- thats when life becomes Fruitful 

(if you're hopped on , don't celebrate, continue the work, till: <br />
-of course, do not forget to:<br />

3.1.**Enjoy**: admire _the simplicity_,of repeating`the Hobby` *(any nuance?)*<br />

3.2.**Flow**:  forcing not any  Computation. but, notice that you Are **Already Flowing** in it (& with it), 
changing amongt life's  fluctuating criss-crossing paths, refactoring, & meeting up once again üòÉ <br />

(*until* `<min(Bladder_capacity, programming[High] , Hunger >` - Assuming *no phone is on-Board!* )<br /> <br />

3.3.**Remember**: being rooted, & close to earth, *(you're busy, you've forgetten how to breathe, once again)*
 (*only getting Exalted from (overly) getting Excited*, that is a pure butter-nut addiction to binge on)<br/>

## üéâ Fun Trivia

- Honour **Open Source**, Searching for _self-sufficiency_casue half truths won't stisfy my thist to learn more 
(in code & life)

-  a person told me `I alwawys rebuild the wheel` many times  to rekindle the spark of fire in me (& for *You*)

- Vegan & Spiritual, [Functional working bee]()- (_goodies_ in, _goodies_ out). In a search of a lost _Stability_ (even in a materialistic realm) 

- Adore _Spacing Out_ (&  the Creativity it brings:
love how earth Smells in _the dusk_, slightly before it rains. Don't mind stepping into it. drifting in cozy warmness, while listening its teardrops, trickiling through the windowpane. But,when two drops meet, that must be an `enticing Camelot` of the day üòä

- _Syrian_, Burned my Vessesls, & Entered the **United States**, Despite disrimanatory hurdles of the few,
Only have earned it,
with the _Love_, _Democracy_ & _Justice_ of the **People**  &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; ü§† üá∫üá∏

- **4 hrs** is average Recharge time (+/- 2 hrs variance ) -_Siestez, c'est parfait, alors!_- unless I'm truly sick, (better yet , having a Spiritual Revelation)_

- **TV is not a joker**, appreciate small things-  (_the smell of the earth, while the teardrops trickling on a windowpane is a pure Camelot_)

- Stuck between **the Dichotomy** of this _Occam's Razor_: Sweetness of a _Coconut_, & the Bitterness of _Dark Chocolate_ (to be frank, how *One day* the `inner-self` is helpful but stays swinging to the other pole, like a pendulum)

- Currently Programming: 
1. [*DeepLearner*](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/DeepLearner)
2. [_Accouting_](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/Thee-accountant) 
3. [_Finance_](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/SolvencyPredictor/blob/main/README.md)


- Future projects 
1. _Econmics_ ( _AI_ empowered **soon**,_lah_)(_the Hard Truth:_**It's a Stochastic Process Optimization**)
2. _**stochastic Processes** (all made out of the fabric of same ol' Uniformity
3. **Genetic algorithm**, reproduction, &  Reinforcement Learning model
4. ***Mathemematics** (gaming theory, until far in the pits of abstraction)
5. _(Statistical) **Physics**_ (Abstract Algebra et al.)
## Current Plateau
the **Fractional** [_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=Fractional+Ornstein-Uhlenbeck+model&btnG=)  & above
-**Hilbert space** functions, & other Quantum pals
