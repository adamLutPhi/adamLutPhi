If there are an ideas you'd like me to try out, _experiment_ & _explore_ [& **create**]- any sand castels, that needs sophisticated math modelling (Energy, flow , or flux) -
do you have a _model in mind_

is it just &  random variable i.i.d
Gaussian?
Maybe a  _Paratian_?
Or perhaps a _Laplacian_?
even if you're unsure,
