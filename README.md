## Pathei-Mathos


- the golden Rule: "know that there is everything for everyone" 
- It all starts with a right mindset, that stems aa right programming language
- morning starts: from an Idea, delve into 
- feel the painful Disappointement of a  Failure
- learn from past Mistakes 
- Move onto the next Journey
- life is not just about suffering, but in _the way_ you dance around it


## Motivation
```
_To live one more, another day
& share more than yesterday_
```
