- It all starts with the __Right Mindset__, that stems from  a right Programming Attitude

- Feel at ease with the painful _Disappointement of Failure_
 learning from **Past Mistakes** - adding to the _Experience Database_

- Life is not just about suffering, learn how to go _the way_  around **the Pit of DEATH** _dancing_ your way around it- then Move onto the next Journey
