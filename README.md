Before we could be *Computer Scientists*, we were Writers,
 yet before that, we must had been **_pure Philosophers_"**
<br />
- the Golden Rule: "know that there is ~~everything~~ `something` for everyone, which stems from :<br />

*1.1. **Close*** an `open-loop`  that is nagging, One loop at a time- promise? <br/>

_1.2. **Do**_ a Minor good (whichever you may percieve ) <br/>

_1.3. **Rewind**_ repetition of _#1.1._ _(it only gets better, with time)_ <br/>

Feel at ease, from the steep path of Failures_, as there is still time to:

_2.1. **Learn**_ something similar, easier to maintain  *( `ERROR!`you know it sounds *familiar*);worst thing, wouldd be losing nothing but the Battle _(cut your losses short)_ <br />

_2.2. **Do**_ the *work, daily on `Perfecting your Craft` , & care less about any outcomes; living in a goal-less life. (you stop one project, yet start another)
yet we meet a fresh one, with the  excitness of a newborn! _(so how much should you care, about ge any result in life)_? <br />

_2.3. **Magic**_ *ah..* that moment, when the magic comes- you don't realize it, before it invites you into the `Zone` <br />
Once inside, the `track of time gets _loose_-;  start feeling carried away, _(like riding sea waves)_

celebration is yet to come, please continue the work, till: _(of course, don't forget to):_<br />

_3.1.**Enjoy**_ admire _the simplicity_,of repeating`the Hobby` *(any nuance?)*
<br />

_3.2.**Flow**_  without forcing not any thoughts. Note you Are **Already Flowing** in it (& with it), 
changing amongst life's  fluctuating criss-crossing paths, maybe like any `refactoring`, & meeting up once again üòÉ <br />
(*until* `min(Bladder_capacity, programming[High] , Hunger)` - Assuming *no phone is on-Board!* )<br /> <br />

_3.3.**Remember**_ being rooted, & down to earth, *(or you're so busy, you've forgetten how to breathe, once again?)*
 (*only getting Exalted from (overly) getting Excited*, that is a pure Butter-nut addiction to binge on)<br/>

It is safe to say that there is a `Sisyphus` in all of us- whether if we're **fierce** like a Roman, or slow like a Turtle _( it doesn't matter much)_
<br/>

  
## How About You?

I'm a bit low on **Telephathy**, so I couldn't tell what _'Turns your Rocker'_? üòÑ

_(You gotta love it- living here,  for a while...)_

## üéâ Fun Trivia

- Honour **Open Source**, Searching for `self-sufficiency` in code, completing the missing picture of mosaic wonder- as half truths won't satisfy the nagging Thirst to learn _(in code & life)_

-  been told  I'm always `rebuilding the wheel`! I am doing so that the `Spark of fire` in me can be rekindled, then, It could be transferred to *You*

- Vegan & Spiritual, [Functional working bee](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychiatric-bulletin/article/the-genesis-of-artistic-creativity-aspergers-syndrome-and-the-arts-michael-fitzgerald-jessica-kingsley-2005-1395-pb-256-pp-isbn-1-84310-334-6/E7E34A4440E1D96A2D8B696669694BB6)- (_goodies_ in, _goodies_ out). In a search of a lost _Stability_ (even in a Materialistic realm) 

- Adore _Spacing Out_ (&  the Creativity it brings:
love how the earth Smells in _the dusk_, slightly before it rains _( Don't mind stepping into it)._<br /> Or drifting into some cozy warmness, while listening to its teardrops, **trickiling down**  fast through the _windowpane_, But,when two drops meet, that must be an `enticing Camelot` of the day üòä

- _Syrian_, Burned my Vessesls, & Entered the **United States**, Despite disrimanatory hurdles of the few,
Only have earned it,
with the _Love_, _Democracy_ & _Justice_ of the **People**  &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; ü§† üá∫üá∏

- **4 hrs** is average Recharge time _(+/- 2 hrs variance )_ -_Siestez, c'est parfait, alors!_- unless I'm truly sick, (better yet , having a Spiritual Revelation)_

- Stuck between **the Dichotomy** of this _Occam's Razor_: Sweetness of a _Coconut_, & the Bitterness of _Dark Chocolate_ (to be frank, I Wonder how *One day* the `inner-self` is helpful, yet  it goees back, swinging in Chaos , like a pendulum)

- **The Silver-Screen is an outdated**

Small things, is what I do, like trying the sweet moistiness of `Tarte Tatin`, or the zestiness of  `Mee Goreng`
Reciting the rights of Man with M.`Fran√ßois Quesnay` _(thanks for showing me how to act)_
or coding while listening to the generous crumbs & tones  of `les Gymnop√©dies` piano; Once again, swirling around, trying to be perfected, this time, from gentle fabric of fancy clouds of Purity- fabricated by the only `Erik Satie`
What you know, maybe life is `Topsy Turvy`, like a Floating Dream.. so real like the codex of `√Ä la Recherche du temps Perdu`

I don't wanna lose you, M. `Marcel Proust`, because your words has yet to make me remember, what it feels like, & means, to be a Human.. Once Again
