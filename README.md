# üêâ Pathei-Mathos

the __Right Mindset__, you start with: <br />
- the Golden Rule: "know that there is ~~everything~~ `something` for everyone, which stems from :<br />

*1.1. **Close*** an `open-loop`  that is nagging One loop at a time- promise? <br/>

*1.2. **Do*** a Minor good (whichever you may percieve ) <br/>

_1.3. **Rewind**_ _#1.1_ _(it gets only better, with time)_ <br/>

Feel at ease from the steepness of Failure_, as there's still time to:

_2.1. **Learn**_ something similar, easier to maintain  *( `ERROR!` sounds *familiar?*) worst thing, you'd be losing the current battle _(cut your losses short)_ <br />

_2.2. **Do**_ the work, daily , & care less about any outcomes - remember, you are living in a goal-less life <br />

2.3. **Magic**: ah, that moment, when the magic comes- invites you  enter into the `Zone` <br />
and be in the moment- thats when life becomes Fruitful 

(if you're hopped on , don't celebrate, continue the work, till: <br />
-of course, do not forget to:<br />

3.1.**Enjoy**: admire _the simplicity_,of repeating`the Hobby` *(any nuance?)*<br />

3.2.**Flow**:  forcing not any  Computation. but, notice that you Are **Already Flowing** in it (& with it), 
changing amongt life's  fluctuating criss-crossing paths, refactoring, & meeting up once again üòÉ <br />

(*until* `<min(Bladder_capacity, programming[High] , Hunger >` - Assuming *no phone is on-Board!* )<br /> <br />

3.3.**Remember**: being rooted, & close to earth, *(you're busy, you've forgetten how to breathe, once again)*
 (*only getting Exalted from (overly) getting Excited*, that is a pure butter-nut addiction to binge on)<br/>

It is safe to say that there is a `Sisyphus` in all of us- whether if we're fierce like a Roman, or slow like a Turtle, really, it doesn't matter, you know 
<br/>

I'm a bit low on **Telephathy**, so I couldn't exactly Tell what _'Turns your Rocker'_? üòÑ

## üéâ Fun Trivia

- Honour **Open Source**, Searching for `self-sufficiency` ,as half truths won't stisfy my thist to learn more 
_(in code & life)_

-  Once told me `I alwawys rebuilding the wheel`! Well, i am doing what i can now, to rekindle the spark of fire in me, then, in a Subsequence, It would be transferrd to *You*

- Vegan & Spiritual, [Functional working bee](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychiatric-bulletin/article/the-genesis-of-artistic-creativity-aspergers-syndrome-and-the-arts-michael-fitzgerald-jessica-kingsley-2005-1395-pb-256-pp-isbn-1-84310-334-6/E7E34A4440E1D96A2D8B696669694BB6)- (_goodies_ in, _goodies_ out). In a search of a lost _Stability_ (even in a materialistic realm) 

- Adore _Spacing Out_ (&  the Creativity it brings:
love how earth Smells in _the dusk_, slightly before it rains. Don't mind stepping into it. drifting in cozy warmness, while listening its teardrops, **frickely trickiling ** through the _windowpane_, But,when two drops meet,ah, that must be an `enticing Camelot` of the day üòä

- _Syrian_, Burned my Vessesls, & Entered the **United States**, Despite disrimanatory hurdles of the few,
Only have earned it,
with the _Love_, _Democracy_ & _Justice_ of the **People**  &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; ü§† üá∫üá∏

- **4 hrs** is average Recharge time _(+/- 2 hrs variance )_ -_Siestez, c'est parfait, alors!_- unless I'm truly sick, (better yet , having a Spiritual Revelation)_


- Stuck between **the Dichotomy** of this _Occam's Razor_: Sweetness of a _Coconut_, & the Bitterness of _Dark Chocolate_ (to be frank, I Wonder how *One day* the `inner-self` is helpful but stays swinging to the other pole, like a pendulum)

- **The Silver-Screen is an outdated**, small things, is what I do, like the moistiness of `Tarte Tatin`, or zestiness of  `Mee Goreng`. reciting the rights of man, how he should act, ME`Fran√ßois Quesnay`, or coding while hearing the generous crumbs of `les Gymnop√©dies`; Once again, trying to be perfected, this time, from gentle fabric of fancy clouds of Purity, provided by `Erik Satie`. What you know, maybe life is Topsy Turvy, like a Floating Dream.. so real like the codex of `√Ä la recherche du temps Perdu`.  I don't wanna lose you, M. `Marcel Proust`, because your words has yet to make me remmber, what it feels like, & Means, to be a Human, Once Again
