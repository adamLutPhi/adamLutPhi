# Pathei-Mathos
the __Right Mindset__, you start with: <br/>
- the Golden Rule: "know that there is ~~everything~~ something for everyone
(that , which has most of the value in it- for you at least, you feel it, because you're still reading)
- that stems from :<br/>
1.1. **Close**: an `open-loop`: that exiting process, One loop at a time, promise?) <br/>
1.2. **Do**: a Minor good (that, whichever you may percieve ) <br/>
1.3. **Redo**: no.#1 _(only it gets better, with time)_ <br/>
- Feel at ease with the Painful _Disappointement of Failure_ (by doing this life algorithm
(as a programmer, you sure got used to the ERROR Message, I presume )
2.1. **Learn**: something similar: easy to maintain  `ERROR!` sound familiar? you've lost the current battle (cut your losses short) <br/>
2.2. **Do**: the work, daily , & care less about any outcomes - remember, you are living in a goal-less life <br/>
2.3. **Magic**: ah, that moment, when the magic comes- invites you  enter into the `Zone` <br/>
and be in the moment- thats when life becomes fruitful & bareable; (if you're hopped on , don't celebrate, continue the work, till: 

3.1.Enjoy: despite _the simplicity_,of Doing `the Hobby` 
3.2.Flow: you don't have to Flow, because you'll be already be flowing in it (& with it), 
changing between lanes of life's many paths. (until `min(bladder_capacity, programming[High], hunger)` - Assuming no phone is on-Board! )
3.3.Recall: Possibilities ( seemd so interested, that you seemed to forget how to breathe,again(sigh, yawn included) [the pure addition of `_"only getting Exhalted with the (overly) being Excited"_ feeling` is speechless]

    
 letting the moment live its full potential (with or without a vegan **cool-Aide**) would prove to be helpful(may be overlasting, too)
 you might feel like another Sysiphus, moving the mental bagage around the bushes,  maybe doing the same routine programming shores _(regardless what value life truly holds within)_ 
 like a river, flowing within a perfect circle _( or infinity )_
 the ultimate way to move forward, is by learning from **Past Mistakes**, simmering past emotions, & reflecting on it. thus, we can add that last 'funny incident', to the _Experience Database_; 
 recalling it as a memoir for how funny & goofy state (we were in), such that even the sharpest minds can `Fallback` to
(Everything is Energy, that is differentially fluctuatating, with the passing of time-so nothing is absolutely Lost )

- Life is not just about suffering (thats the first scene in a play),
 Fighting off your dragons never came off as an easy task,
 You Gotta learn how to go _all the way_ first (by doing what you know Best ), taking note of  **the Pit of Demise** (like any last steps of a patient's recovery), _dancing_  around it- transcending off it; then, only when ready, Moving onto the _next Journey_
(Which has already been set in motion, as you've always been prepared for that 'Particular Moment', as nothing happens by a mere, Naive 'Coincident' ( no matter how much you reset the experiment) 
## Fun Trivia

- Honour **Open Source**

- Vegan & Spiritual, & [Highly Functional](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/autism-hidden-advantages/406180/) working bee- (_goodies_ in, _goodies_ out). In a search of a lost _Stability_ (even in a materialistic realm) 

- Appreciate _Spacing Out_ (&  the Creativity it brings)

- __Syrian_, burned my vessesls, & Entered the **United States**, Despite disrimanatory irritation of the few,
Only have earned it,
with the _Love_, _Democracy_ & _Justice_ of the **People**  &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1F8; ðŸ¤  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

- **4 hrs** is average Recharge time (+/- 2 hrs) -_Siestez, c'est parfait, alors!_- unless I'm truly sick, (even better, having a Spiritual Revelation)

- **TV no more** but appreciate small things-  (_the smell of the earth, while the teardrops trickling on a windowpane is a pure Camelot_)

- Stuck between **the Dichotomy** of this _Occam's Razor_: Sweetness of a _Coconut_, & the Bitterness of _Dark Chocolate_ (frankly,  how *One day* your innerself proves helpful, but becomes disobidient on other ones)

-    are a huge **Turn On** that they bring an awe(almost surely)

## How About You?

I'm a bit low on **Telephathy**, so I couldn't exactly Tell what _'Turns your Rocker'_? ðŸ˜„

If there are an ideas you'd like me to try out, _experiment_, _explore_,& [**create**]- any sand castels, that needs sophisticated math modelling, creating a a win-win situation (for all parties)

what is the greatest thing you could **Dream Off**?
Feel free drop me a line - who knows, maybe it will be the **next Big Thing**
