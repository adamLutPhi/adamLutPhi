_"Before_ we could be _Computer Scientists_, we were Writers,
yet before that, we may have been __pure Philosophers"__  return

- the Golden Rule: know that there is `something` for everyone, which stems from :  

1.1. __Close__ a nagging `open-loop`, One loop at a time  

1.2.__Do__ a Minor good (whichever you may perceive)  

1.3. __Rewind__ repetition of #1.1.__(it only gets better, with time)_  

Feel at ease, from the steep path of _Failures_, as there is still time to:  

2.1. __Learn__ something similar, easier to maintain *(`ERROR!`you know it sounds_familiar_);worst thing, would be losing nothing but the Battle _(cut your losses short)_  

_2.2. __Fullfil__ the work, daily on `Mastering your Craft`, care less about an outcome; living in a goal-less life. (you stop one project, yet start another)
yet we meet a fresh one, with the excitement of a newborn
_(how much should you care, about any result in life)_?  

2.3. __Magic__ _ah..._ that moment, when the magic comes- you don't realize it, before it invites you into the `Zone`  

Once inside, the `track of time gets _loose_,¬†feeling carried away, _(like riding sea waves)_  

Celebration is yet to come, please continue the work, till: _(of course, don't forget to):  

3.1.__Enjoy__ admire _the simplicity_, of repeating Hobby` _(any nuance?)_  

_3.2.__Flow___without forcing not any thoughts. Note you Are Already `Flowing` in it (& with it),
changing among life's fluctuating crisscrossing paths, maybe like any `refactoring`, then meeting up once again üòÉ  

(_until_ `min(Bladder_capacity, programming[High], Hunger)` - Assuming _no phone is on-Board_)  

3.3. __Remember__ being `rooted`, & down to earth, _(or you're so busy, you've forgotten how to breathe, once again?)_  

(_only getting Exalted from (overly) getting Excited_, that is a pure Butter-nut addiction to binge on)  

It is safe to say that there is a `Sisyphus` in all of us- whether we're __fierce__ like a `Roman`, or slow like a `Turtle` _(it doesn't matter much)_  

## How About You

I'm a bit low on __Telepathy__, so I couldn't tell what _'Turns your Rocker'_? üòÑ

## programming

### Currently Programming

1. [_Deep-learner_](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/DeepLearner)
2. [_Accounting_](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/Thee-accountant)
3. [_Finance_](https://github.com/adamwillisXanax/SolvencyPredictor/blob/main/README.md)

### Future projects

1. _Economics_ (_AI_ empowered __soon__, lah)(_funny thing no one talks about that:_It's a __Stochastic Process Optimization)__
2. __stochastic Processes__ (out of the fabric of same old _Uniformity_)_
3. __Genetic algorithm__ _(Reinforcement Learning model, replication)_
4. __Mathematics__ _(Applied optimization until deep far in the pits of Abstraction -Real Analysis)_
5. _(Statistical)_ __Physics__ _(Abstract Algebra et al.)_

## Current Plateau

the _Fractional_ [_ornstein-uhlenbeck model_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=Fractional+Ornstein-Uhlenbeck+model&btnG=)
_(You got to love it, living here, for a while...)_

## üéâ Fun Trivia

- Honor __Open Source__, Searching for `self-sufficiency` in code, completing the missing picture of mosaic wonder- as half-truths won't satisfy the nagging Thirst to learn _(in code & life)_  

- Been told I'm always `rebuilding the wheel`. I am doing¬†it so that¬†`the Spark of fire` in me can be rekindled, hence, It could be transferred to _You_

- Vegan & Spiritual, [Functional working bee](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychiatric-bulletin/article/the-genesis-of-artistic-creativity-aspergers-syndrome-and-the-arts-michael-fitzgerald-jessica-kingsley-2005-1395-pb-256-pp-isbn-1-84310-334-6/E7E34A4440E1D96A2D8B696669694BB6)- (_goodies_ in, _goodies_ out). In a search of a lost _Stability_ (even in a Materialistic realm)  

- _Spacing Out_ -the Creativity it brings:
How the earth Smells at _dusk_, slightly before it rains _(Don't mind stepping into it)  

Drifting into cozy warmness,¬†listening to its teardrops, __trickling down__¬†fast through the _windowpane_, But, when two drops meet, that must be an `enticing Camelot` of the day üòä  

- _Syrian_, Burned my Vessels, & Entered the __United States__, Despite discriminatory hurdles of the few,
Only have earned it,
- __4 hrs__ is average Recharge time _(+/- 2 hrs variance)_ -_Siestez, c'est parfait, alors!_- unless I'm truly sick, (better yet, having a Spiritual Revelation)_  

- Stuck between __the Dichotomy__ of this _Occam's Razor_: Sweetness of a _Coconut_, & the Bitterness of _Dark Chocolate_ (to be frank, I Wonder how _One day_ the `inner-self` is helpful, yet it goes back, swinging in Chaos, like a pendulum)  

- __The Silver-Screen is _not worth it_

Small things, is what I do, like trying the sweet moistness of `Tarte Tatin`, the tastiness of¬†`Mee Goreng`
Reciting the rights of Man with M. `Fran√ßois Quesnay` _(thanks for showing me how to act)_
or coding while listening to the generous crumbs & tones¬†of `les Gymnop√©dies` [piano](https://youtu.be/4LYRufaWpbk?t=152); Once again, swirling around, trying to be perfected, this time, from gentle fabric of fancy clouds of Purity- fabricated by the only `Erik Satie`
What you know, maybe life is `Topsy-Turvy`, like a Floating Dream... so real like the codex of `√Ä la Recherche du temps Perdu`  

I don't want to lose you, M. `Marcel Proust`, because your words has yet to make me remember, what it feels like, & means, to be a Human... Once Again
